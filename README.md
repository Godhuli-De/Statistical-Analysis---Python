# Statistical-Analysis---Python

This project performs a detailed statistical analysis on a dataset of 500 individuals, focusing on their height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The analysis includes:

* Calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and mode for height, weight, and BMI.
* Visualizing data distributions using box plots and histograms to show the mean, median, and mode.
* Determining the most common gender in the dataset.
* Computing the variance and standard deviation for height and weight.
* Analyzing quartiles for height and weight.
* Calculating covariance and correlation between height, weight, and BMI.
* Creating scatter plots and pair plots to visualize relationships between the variables.
  
The project leverages libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. Authored by @Godhuli De.
